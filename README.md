# File Duplicate Remover ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Tired of having your favorite tunes doubled up in your music library? Or your photos duplicated by multiple photo storage apps? This handy Python script is here to save the day!

## What it does

* **Finds duplicate files:**  It dives deep into your folders, finding those sneaky duplicate files.
* **Removes the extras:**  It carefully removes extra copies, leaving you with just one of each file.
* **Frees up space:**  Reclaim precious disk space for more music, photos, or whatever you love.

## How to use it

1. **Make a backup:** Just in case, make a copy of your file folder before running the script.
2. **Edit the path:** Open the `dupes.py` file and change the `/path/to/your/files` path to where your files live.
3. **Run the script:**  Open your terminal and type `python3 dupes.py` or just 'dupes.py' if you stored the script within a directory in your OS path.  

## Enjoy your de-duplicated files!
